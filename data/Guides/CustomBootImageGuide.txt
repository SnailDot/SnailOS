1: To use a custom boot image, move a .jpg file into SnailOS/Assets.
2: rename the picture you want as your custom boot image "Boot.jpg".
3: Now when you reboot SnailOS, your boot image will be displayed.

4: If theres no "Boot.jpg" image there, SnailOS will instead launch the text boot splash instead, which you can also customize.
